                <p> Muay Thai or Thai Boxing is the national sport and cultural martial art of Thailand.
                  It was developed several hundreds of years ago as a form of close-combat that utilizes the entire body as a weapon.
                  Today its definitive origins are debated by modern scholars, as much of the muay thai history was lost when the Burmese ransacked Ayudhaya, Siamâ€™s capital city in Thailand, during the 14th century.

                <p>Submission wrestling is a form of competition and a general term for martial arts and combat sports that focus on clinch and ground fighting with the aim of obtaining a submission through the use of submission holds. The term "submission wrestling" usually refers only to the form of competition and training that does not use a gi, or "combat kimono", of the sort often worn with belts that establish rank by color, though some may use the loose trousers of such a uniform, without the jacket. </p>

                <p> Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force him to submit.
                  Due to the fact that control is generally easier on the ground than in a standing position,
                  much of the technique of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is centered round the skill of
                  taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered harmless.

                <p>Many styles of martial arts are practiced for self-defense or include self-defense techniques. Some styles train primarily for self-defense, while other martial or combat sports can be effectively applied for self-defense. Some martial arts train how to escape from a knife or gun situation, or how to break away from a punch, while others train how to attack. To provide more practical self-defense, many modern martial arts schools now use a combination of martial arts styles and techniques, and will often customize self-defense training to suit individual participants.</p>
